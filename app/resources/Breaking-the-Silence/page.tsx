                    Abuse is not always visible or easy to define. It can take many forms—emotional, 
                    physical, psychological, or financial—and often leaves deep, lasting scars. 
                    Recognizing abuse is the first step toward healing and reclaiming your voice. 
                    Remember, you are not alone, and reaching out for support is a sign of strength.

                    Survivors often have to endure long-term trauma that could potentially affect every aspects of their lives in a negative way.
                    On the other-hand, those who perpetuate abuse may be doing so out of three reasons:
                    <ul className='list-decimal mt-5 mr-5'>
                        <li>Learned behaviors from their own upbringing or environment</li>
                        <li>Desire to exert control or power over others</li>
                        <li>Unresolved personal trauma or mental health issues</li>
                        <li>Lack of skills to resolve conflict</li>
                    </ul>
                <p className='mt-5'>
                    Wether you realize you have been abused or your actions is beginning to cause harm then acknowledging it is the first step to change. 
                    Abuse likes to thrive in secrecy and it dose it by manipulation, isolation, and making the victim feel guilty or ashamed.

                    <p>
                        Silence can be one of the most powerful tools used by abusers to maintain control and perpetuate harm. Breaking the silence is not just about telling your story—it’s about reclaiming your power, validating your experiences, and inspiring others to do the same. When you speak out, you challenge the stigma and shame that often surround abuse, and you open the door for healing and justice.
                    </p>
                    <ul className='list-disc ml-5 mt-4'>
                        <li>Sharing your experience can help others recognize signs of abuse in their own lives.</li>
                        <li>Speaking up can connect you with supportive communities and resources.</li>
                        <li>Your voice can influence change in social attitudes and policies.</li>
                        <li>Breaking the silence can be the first step toward personal freedom and recovery.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h1 className='text-2xl mt-10 mb-5'>How to Begin Breaking the Silence</h1>
                    <p>
                        Finding the courage to speak out is a deeply personal journey. You may choose to confide in a trusted friend, family member, counselor, or support group. Remember, you control your story—share only what you feel comfortable with, and at your own pace.
                    </p>
                    <ul className='list-disc ml-5 mt-4'>
                        <li>Write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal as a first step.</li>
                        <li>Reach out to a helpline or support organization for confidential guidance.</li>
                        <li>Consider joining a peer support group where others understand your experience.</li>
                        <li>Practice self-compassion and acknowledge your bravery in taking this step.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className='mt-5'>
                        Every time someone breaks the silence, it chips away at the barriers that keep abuse hidden. Your voice matters—not just for your own healing, but for the countless others who may be inspired to seek help and hope.
